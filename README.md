# Project2
This is a project that attempts to create REST routes and the semblence of a storefront. Presenting data and rendering it to the browser.

There is an index page, a welcome page, a show page that shows each individual item, a form that creates a new item, a form to edit an existing item that will gain further functionality along with a link to delete an item.

This is a work in progress and thanks go to my classmates and all of the resources available on youtube and via google.
